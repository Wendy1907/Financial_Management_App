# Financial Management

## Transaction Tracker

### About:
**Financial Management** is a desktop application that helps users to manage their finances. 
Users can track the transaction history and show the balance and total amount of money inside 
their accounts to help them manage their finances better.

### User object:
This application would be useful for everybody. The app can help them have a better view of
their current financial status by recording spending and earnings, checking their balance, 
viewing the transaction history, and thereby making a better decision whenever they want 
to spend on something.

### Inspiration:
My main inspiration for this idea comes from my own experience. As a student who lives far
from my family, I have to pay for many things in my daily life, and tracking my finances
is a need for me to give me a better view of my financial status, and also what I should
do to save money. I always want to find an app that satisfies all of my need for financial
tracking and analyzing my data, however, most apps does not have enough feature to do that. 
Hence, I want to try and create an application that can do all features that help me to 
manage my financial status well. For this program, I will only be focusing on designing 
transactions record and showing the analysis of the total spending and earnings in finance 
management.
